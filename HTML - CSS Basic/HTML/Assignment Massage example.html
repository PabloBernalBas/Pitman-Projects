				<blockquote>
				You don't have to spend a lot of time on stretching exercises to get the benefits. <br>

				Have you thought about stretching as a gentle way to ease yourself into the day? <br>

				Getting yourself up and moving in the morning isnâ€™t always easy. <br>
				At the moment, in particular, many of us are having to stay indoors due to the coronavirus outbreak. <br>
				You may find that on some days, you wake up feeling sluggish, aching, and full of tension, <br>
				potentially caused by being less physically active during the day or having worked on a laptop for lengthy periods.<br>

				"Tight muscles can cause undue strain on the neighboring joints during normal daily function, <br>
				or they themselves can become injured," Sasha Cyrelson, D.P.T.<br>
